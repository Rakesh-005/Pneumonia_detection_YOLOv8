# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays Using YOLOv8 🩺📸

A deep learning project that applies YOLOv8 for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images with high accuracy.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Early detection of pneumonia is crucial. We use a robust object detection model (YOLOv8) to locate signs of pneumonia in medical images.
